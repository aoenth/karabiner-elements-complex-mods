## Modifications for Software Dvorak Keyboards
Applicable to Macs using the "Dvorak Keyboard Layout" ![](README_files/dv_icon.png), the resulting key would remap into Dvorak on the system level.

|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| ⌘ J            | ⌘ I            | ⌘ C             |
| ⌘ K            | ⌘ . (Period)   | ⌘ V             |
| ⌘ Q            | ⌘ B            | ⌘ X             |
